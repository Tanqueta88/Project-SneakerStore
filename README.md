## 🙋 FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
### 1. I cloned the project but when I try to run it I get an error. Because?
Since this project was created in Visual Studio Community and not in Visual Studio Code, make sure to run the project inside the folder called "SneakerStore" and not inside the one called "Partial1HDP".

### 2. I'm in the SneakerStore folder but I still can't run the application.
Remember to install .NET and, if possible, restart the machine once done. The installation guide can be found in the Requirements section above.

### 3. I run the project, it does not throw any errors, however the application does not open.
If you are running the application from a terminal and not from the Visual Studio Community, you have to search within the terminal for a URL and click on it to open the application in your web browser. It usually has this format:

If that link is not "clickable" you can copy the URL and paste it into your web browser!
